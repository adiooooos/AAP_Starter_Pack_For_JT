# Role Default Variables: Filesystem Check Role
# ============================================================================
#
# Description:
#   Default variables for the filesystem_check role. These variables define
#   which filesystem types and mount points to exclude from checking, and
#   where to store reports.
#
# Customization:
#   Modify exclude_fs_types to add or remove filesystem types you want to
#   exclude from checking (e.g., virtual filesystems, network filesystems).
#   Modify exclude_mount_points to exclude specific mount points (e.g., root
#   filesystem which typically requires rescue mode for checking).

# Filesystem types to exclude from checking
# These are typically virtual or special filesystems that don't require
# traditional filesystem checking
exclude_fs_types:
  - tmpfs
  - devtmpfs
  - iso9660
  - squashfs
  - overlay
  - nfs
  - cifs
  - sysfs
  - proc
  - devfs
  - autofs

# Mount points to exclude from checking
# Root filesystem (/) typically requires rescue mode for checking, so it's
# excluded by default. Add other mount points as needed.
exclude_mount_points:
  - /

# Base path for report storage on remote hosts
report_base_path: "/tmp"

# Destination path on control node for collected reports
collection_dest_path: "/tmp"
